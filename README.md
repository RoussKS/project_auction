# project_auction
Online Auctions Project

This project was a Dissertation Project for University of Patras, Greece.
School of Engineering, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

It was build using PHP, MySql, Bootstrap Framework 2.3.2

It is an almost working copy that implements most of the needed functions.
These include, registering a user, login, logout, creating an auction, messaging etc.

Yet, there is a lot more work to be done, in order to put it in production.

Texts & most of comments were translated into English. Yet, if you found any greek comments please inform me.


Steps to follow for use:

1. Load the mysql/dump.sql directory structure file
2. init-example.php needs to be renamed to init.php with your DB credentials



ps.
I do not have any intention of updating the current implementation, as it needs a lot of changes.
Additionally, this was not the project's initial goal. It is still just a dissertation project.

Thus, upgrading will be a separate project that will include:

1. Fully OOP
2. Redesign using MVC Pattern & several Libraries for Routing, Sessions & more
3. Bootstrap 3 implementation
4. Fully changing folder/file structure as a result of the above.
